# MinionSpeech
I simply love the minions and their awesome language! My hobby is studying their language. So far I modeled their sentence structure as follows:

```
S  -> NP VP
NP -> Det N
PP -> P Det Adj N
VP -> V | V PP
```

Thanks to my long studies, I was also able to translate a number of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and prepositions (see my collected files).
